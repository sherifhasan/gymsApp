# GymsApp

GymsApp is an Android app that shows a list of gyms using Retrofit for network calls, Firebase Realtime Database for remote data storage, Room for local data storage, and MVVM as the architecture pattern. Hilt is used for dependency injection, and Jetpack Compose is used for creating the UI screens.
